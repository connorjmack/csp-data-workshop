# Wrap-Up & Next Steps

Congratulations — you've completed the Data Engineering Workshop!

---

## What You've Accomplished

- [x] Set up **Gemini Pro** with free student access
- [x] Created a **GitHub** account and your first repository
- [x] Learned to **navigate the terminal** and use essential commands
- [x] Installed and used **Gemini CLI** for AI-assisted coding
- [x] Built a real **data pipeline** analyzing the Keeling Curve dataset
- [x] Experienced the difference between **manual** and **AI-assisted** development

## Key Skills You've Gained

**Technical:**

- Python data manipulation with pandas
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Working with real-world messy data (comments, missing values, inconsistent formats)
- Building reproducible data pipelines

**AI-Assisted Development:**

- Effective prompting for code generation
- Reviewing and improving AI-generated code
- Knowing when to use AI vs. writing code manually
- Iterating quickly with an AI coding assistant

## Where to Go From Here

### Deepen your Python skills

- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (free online)
- [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- Practice on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) with their free courses

### Learn more Git

- [Git Branching Tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) (interactive, visual)
- Try creating branches, making pull requests, and working with a classmate on the same repo

### Explore more data engineering tools

- **SQL** — The foundation of data engineering. Try [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) with your CO₂ data.
- **dbt** — Data transformation framework. See [dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/).
- **Apache Airflow** — Workflow orchestration. Schedule your pipeline to run automatically.
- **Docker** — Containerize your pipeline so it runs anywhere.

### Try a bigger project

Ideas using the skills from this workshop:

- **Weather data pipeline** — Fetch weather data from NOAA, join it with CO₂ data, analyze correlations
- **Stock market tracker** — Download daily prices, compute moving averages, generate alerts
- **Social data analysis** — Analyze a public dataset (Census, WHO, World Bank) and create a report
- **Automated reporting** — Schedule a pipeline that emails you a weekly data summary
