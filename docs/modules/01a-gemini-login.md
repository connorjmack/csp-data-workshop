## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Go to the Gemini sign-up page

Navigate to:

```
https://gemini.google.com
```

### 2. Sign in with your university Google account

!!! warning "Use your `.edu` email"
    You **must** use a Google account associated with your university email (e.g., `yourname@university.edu`). Personal Gmail accounts do not qualify for the free student tier.

- Click **Sign in** in the top-right corner
- Select your university Google account, or click **Use another account** and enter your `.edu` credentials
- Complete any two-factor authentication prompts

### 3. Verify student access

Once signed in, you should see the Gemini chat interface. To confirm you have Pro access:

1. Click your **profile icon** (top-right)
2. Look for **"Gemini Pro"** or **"Google One AI Premium"** in your plan details
3. If you see "Gemini" (without Pro), you may need to activate the student benefit

### 4. Activate the student benefit (if needed)

If Pro isn't automatically enabled:

1. Visit [one.google.com/about/plans](https://one.google.com/about/plans)
2. Look for the **Google One AI Premium** plan
3. Click **Try it** — it should show as **free** for eligible students
4. Follow the prompts to verify your student status via your university email

!!! tip "Verification can take a few minutes"
    Google may need to verify your student status with your institution. If it doesn't work immediately, wait 5–10 minutes and try again.

## Confirm It's Working

Open [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com) and try a test prompt:

```
What is the Keeling Curve and why does it matter for climate science?
```

If you get a detailed response, you're all set!

## Troubleshooting

??? question "My university email isn't recognized"
    Some universities use Google Workspace but haven't enabled Gemini access. Contact your university IT department and ask if Google Gemini is available for students.

??? question "I see 'Gemini' but not 'Gemini Pro'"
    Try visiting the Google One plans page directly and look for a student discount. The upgrade should be free.

??? question "I don't have a university Google account"
    Check with your university — many institutions provide Google Workspace accounts even if they use a different primary email system. Look for IT resources or a "Google for Education" portal.
