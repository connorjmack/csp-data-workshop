## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you will have:

- [x] A **Google Gemini Pro** account (free with your student email)
- [x] A **GitHub** account with your first repository
- [x] Comfort navigating the **terminal / command line**
- [x] **Gemini CLI** installed and configured for AI-assisted coding
- [x] A complete **data pipeline** analyzing the Keeling Curve CO₂ dataset

## Workshop Modules

| Module | Topic | Time Estimate |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **1** | [Getting Started](modules/01-overview.md) — accounts, tools, and your first repo | ~30 min |
| **2** | [Terminal Basics](modules/02-terminal-basics.md) — navigating your system from the command line | ~20 min |
| **3** | [Gemini CLI](modules/03a-gemini-cli-install.md) — install and use Google's AI coding assistant | ~20 min |
| **4** | [Keeling Curve Demo](modules/04a-keeling-overview.md) — build a real data pipeline, then rebuild it with AI | ~45 min |

## Prerequisites

- A laptop (macOS, Windows, or Linux)
- A university email address (`.edu`) for Gemini Pro access
- Willingness to experiment — you don't need to know how to code yet!

!!! tip "Mixed experience levels welcome"
    If you've used the terminal before, feel free to skim or skip the basics sections marked with :beginner:. If everything is new, take your time — every section is self-contained.
